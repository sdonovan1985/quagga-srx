BGPSEC-IO is a BGPsec traffic generator that can produce BGP traffic as well
as direct calls into SRxCryptoAPI plugins. It can be used to test software
as well as performance measurements.

The following Modes are supported in this version:

1) BGP  : This mode generates BGP updates containing the BGPSEC path attribute

2) GEN-x: This mode allows to pre-generate bgpsec signed updates for performance
          testing.

3) CAPI : This mode allows to make direct calls into the SRxCryptoAPI to perform
          performance tests of API plugins.

The software can be controlled using a configuration file as well as program
parameters. The traffic is generated by passing scripted updates of the following
form either via command line parameters, piping, or scripted within the 
configuration file.

Update Format:   <prefix>[, [<ASN>[[p|P]<pCount>]]]

Examples:  BGPSEC-IO as ASN 10
           10.0.10.0/24            -> path: 10
           10.0.10.0/24, 20 30     -> path: 10 20 30
           10.0.10.0/24, 20p3 30   -> path: 10 20 20 20 30

Private and Public Keys:
Private and public keys are generated using the key generation functions of the
SRxCryptoAPI. Important here is the key-list.txt file. BGPSEC-IO reads this file 
to pre-load all keys for processing. For more info on keys see the SRxCryptoAPI

For all different settings, please call "bgpsec-io -?" or check the 
configuration file.
