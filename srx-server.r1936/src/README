GNU-Make Information:

The make uses the GNU-Make extension "shell" command. In case
this cases a problem, remove this command from Makefile_Common.
Further documentation is available there. This extension is the 
only reason for the -Wno-portability flag in config.ac

It is recommended to specify the --prefix=<installation location> 
parameter during configuration. Each call of make currently modifies 
the include/srx folder. If will be changed in a later version.

This software package includes the SRx server and the SRx server API. 
In addition it provides additional tools to simulate an RPKI validation
cache and a proxy client implementation.
Please see the documentation for each tool or use the help command on 
the command line.
The srx server itself can be accessed using a telnet clinet. 

For questions please contact the developers at bgpsrx-dev@nist.gov.
To be informed for new releases or minor bug fixes, register with 
bgpsrx-users@nist.gov.
