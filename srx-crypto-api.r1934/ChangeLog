More details on changes are scripted in the files itself.
===========================================================

Version 0.2.0.0 - May/June - 2016
  - Redesigned the API - This API is incompatible with any 0.1.x version.
    * Modified the key generation tools in such that they also generate the 
      key storage structure to be compatible with BIRD reference implementation.
    * All functions are mandatory to be implemented
    * Functions only return two values and more detailed information are 
      returned using a status flag.
    * Only one validate and one sign method - Keys are not passed anymore during
      the validation / sign call - requires pre-registration of keys.
    * API returns the validation hash as as the signature buffer. To free these
      allocated memory the API provides the appropriate free methods.
    * Added capability to set a debug level.
    * Removed requirement to generate API specific BGPSec Path data structure,
      validation will be performed on the BGPSEC path attribute as it is 
      specified in the bgpsec draft (future RFC).
  - Modules MUST provide key management (private / public).
  - API BGPSec_OpenSSL is rewritten to reflect the changes in digest generation 
    as well as API function changes. 
    * Internal key storage is rewritten and moved into its own source
Version 0.1.3.0 - March-April 2016
  - modified structure BGPSecKey to be packed
  - added prefix structure SCA_Prefix
Version 0.1.2.2 - March 2016
  - Modified memory management in sca_generateMSG1 and sca_generateMSG2 to 
    prevent a memory leak.
  - Added NULL check to srxCryptoUnbind
  - Modified configure.ac merging code to distinguish between 32 and 64 bit
Version 0.1.2.1 - January-March 2016
  - Added init method (missing in 0.1.2.0)
  - Fixed bugs
Version 0.1.2.0 - September-December 2015
  - Moved the installed libraries into lib/srx or lib64/srx. Same for the header
    file srxcryptoapi.h - It is not located in srx/srxcryptoapi.h
  - Changed --enable settings (testlib and bgpsec-openssl) to be --without 
    settings. Components are installed by default.
  - Added --without-la-lib which is used for RPM generation. This setting is 
    used in spec file %configure statement to not include .a and .la libraries
    in rpm file.
  _ Restructured initialization code
  - Removed term_debug and added sca_getCurrentLogLevel
  - Added configuration for key file extension for backwards compatibility
  - Modified the key generation to not only produce the PEM encoded key.
    Newly der encoded keys are stores and xxxxx.der
  - Use the DER encoded key rather than the PEM encoded one.
  - Added key storage to BGPSecOpenSSL implementation.
  - The verify and sign methods now take the DER encoded keys.
  _ Added functionality to NOT load functions the plugin reports as not 
    supported - regardless if they are configured or not.
    Example: !isExtended -> extValidate and all public key functions are not 
                            loaded
  - Modified the qsrx-xxx tools to only install keys not already installed.
    Kept backwards compatibility with key filenames. PEM=.key, DER=.der
    The PEM keys are used for srxCryptoAPI 0.1.1.1, all others will use the
    DER encoding.
Version 0.1.1.1 - Arpil 2015
  - Fixed bug in configuration that could cause memory issues
  - Fixed linking problems on Ubuntu systems
Version 0.1.1.0 - March 2015
  - Initial Release
